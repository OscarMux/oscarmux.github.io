        What Do Warming Ocean Temperatures Mean for Kelp?

        The Hidden Champions of Blue Carbon

    <p>
        Undoubtedly the ocean is one of the earth's most (If not the most) valuable resource in the fight against climate change. It is home to large amounts of algae and aquatic plants both in the sea and on the coast which are the best biological carbon sinks out there. The ocean also absorbs huge amounts of heat with low reflection compared to much of the earth’s terrestrial environments. To highlight this the 2013 international panel on climate change (IPCC) revealed that the ocean had <a href='https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/ocean-and-climate-change'>absorbed 93% of the energy produced by the enhanced greenhouse effect.</a> There are many fantastic aquatic environments that are often overlooked and underappreciated. It’s time they got more recognition as the biodiverse climate fighting powerhouses they are.

        Vast swathes of underwater forest cover many coastlines across the world. Slimy tendrils, searching for sunlight reach up from the sea bed. The tendrils are composed of a great collaboration of hyperproductive algae, resulting in a structure called kelp. Kelp is of the order Laminarias of which there are 30 known genera. Macroalgae come together to form brown algae seaweeds which are the blighters known for wrapping around your leg when you least expect it when you’re having a swim at the beach. This stuff is one of the secret key players in the blue carbon cycle acting as an aquatic carbon sink. Other coastal organisms such as the mangroves or seagrasses can capture <a href='https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected'>20x the CO2 per acre that a terrestrial forest does</a>, that is much more impressive than what kelp can do but it’s hidden talent is the rate at which it grows, up to a whopping half metre per day!
