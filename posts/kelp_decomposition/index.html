        Undoubtedly the ocean is one of the earth's most (If not the most) valuable resource in the fight against climate change. It is home to large amounts of algae and aquatic plants both in the sea and on the coast which are the best biological carbon sinks out there. The ocean also absorbs huge amounts of heat with low reflection compared to much of the earth’s terrestrial environments. To highlight this the 2013 international panel on climate change (IPCC) revealed that the ocean had <a href='https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/ocean-and-climate-change' target="_blank">absorbed 93% of the energy produced by the enhanced greenhouse effect.</a> There are many fantastic aquatic environments that are often overlooked and underappreciated. It’s time they got more recognition as the biodiverse climate fighting powerhouses they are.

            Vast swathes of underwater forest cover many coastlines across the world. Slimy tendrils, searching for sunlight reach up from the sea bed. The tendrils are composed of a great collaboration of hyperproductive algae, resulting in a structure called kelp. Kelp is of the order Laminarias of which there are 30 known genera. Macroalgae come together to form brown algae seaweeds which are the blighters known for wrapping around your leg when you least expect it when you’re having a swim at the beach. This stuff is one of the secret key players in the blue carbon cycle acting as an aquatic carbon sink. Other coastal organisms such as the mangroves or seagrasses can capture <a href='https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected' target="_blank">20x the CO2 per acre that a terrestrial forest does</a>, that is much more impressive than what kelp can do but it’s hidden talent is the rate at which it grows, up to a whopping half metre per day!

    <h3>Warming Planet? Can Kelp Help?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
            By this point we are all aware of the plethora of threats presented to us from human influenced climate change as well as just how important it is to be looking decades into the future for strategies for repair, prevention and remediation. I believe kelp could provide some level of relief in future due to its interactions and dispersal patterns that revolve around ocean temperature. <a href='https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-38503/v1' target="_blank"> A fantastic study</a> delves deep into how different temperatures affect the rates of kelp decomposition, which in turn affects its ability to disperse itself and sequester carbon. These key characteristics could become one of the few remaining hopes for reducing the greenhouse effect and the overall effects of climate change.  
    </p>

    <h3>What Did the Kelp Decomposition Study Do?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        Two dominant species of kelp were researched across 12 different locations across the northern hemisphere along a latitudinal range of 28°. This spread was far enough to encounter a wide range of average temperatures which were as high as 18.6°C and as low as 0.6°C. Of course many other variables (notably ones that affect kelp decomposition) were closely monitored on a regular basis to ensure statistical viability.

    <p class="para-margin">
        The researchers collected kelp samples of the same size, shape and weight and contained them in mesh bags. The bags were used to prevent larger herbivores from munching on the kelp which would throw a very obvious spanner in the works. The primary driver for decomposition of kelp comes from Mesograzers, which are small macroinvertebrates capable of easily passing through the mesh bags. All of the samples were kept in similar environmental conditions meaning latitude and subsequently temperature were the only significant variables in the study. After 4-6 weeks half the samples were collected then after another 8-12 weeks the remaining samples were gathered and examined. The two collection windows were used to collect more data regarding the rate of decomposition. 
    </p>

    <h3>What Did the Study Find?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        Surprise surprise, decomposition rates were inversely related to latitude! While this result was expected, it is the ranges of decomposition rates and the implication which is exciting. The average rate of decomposition across every site was 0.74 ± 0.87% d-1 which, for reference, means 50% of the material was lost after 67 days. The two fastest decomposition rates were in Rhode Island & Portugal which were 1.76 ± 0.39% d-1 and 2.63 ± 0.66% d-1 respectively. As soon as you begin to head further north the rates of decomposition in the other sites are much much lower. In fact the lowest rates of decomposition were found in the Norweigan Sea and the Gulf of Alaska, those rates were so low that decomposition was happening backwards! With a rate of 0 - 0.28% d-1 the kelp actually grew in these locations. It is predicted that this is because the temperature of the water is so low that the metabolism of the little mesograzers was slow enough that the amount they need to eat is less than the rate at which the kelp reproduces & grows, even in non-ideal conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The study concluded that the other measured environmental effects were too weak to influence the decomposition rates of the samples and the correlation between latitude and decomposition rates could be described with (Pearson’s R = -0.59, p < 0.001, n = 35). Now, this is pretty interesting stuff. The dramatic difference in decomposition highlights a pretty important feature of the kelp when it comes to the future of our warming planet.

    <h3>A Few Important Characteristics That Make Kelp Cool!</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        Before we get into what kelp can do for our future it’s important that you’re familiar with a few characteristics of kelp regarding its capabilities in the fight against climate change. One of the more notable points is that it decomposes at an incredibly slow rate compared to most other organic sources of carbon such as plankton and feces. It’s rates of decomposition are similar to that of other forms of benthic vegetation. This is important because even when it’s breaking apart and dying it’s still photosynthesizing and pulling CO2 out of the water, so the longer it takes to decompose the more carbon it will absorb. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After spending a bit of time decaying, kelp will eventually sink and get buried under the ocean floor. This means any carbon that it would be releasing back into the atmosphere is instead locked away. Aquatic vegetation locked away like this can act and carbon store for up to 1000 years! Additionally, the aforementioned decomposition study found that there was a significantly negative relationship between initial carbon content and tissue decomposition rate which is likely to indicate that carbon rich kelp may be less palatable for detritivores and microorganisms. So not only does kelp decompose slower once it’s full of carbon but it will also bury itself locking away that carbon for hundreds or thousands of years!

    <h3>The Warming Planet. A Double Edged Sword for Kelp.</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        Kelp forests, just like every other fantastic and beautiful environment on the planet, is no stranger to loss and destruction. This national geographic article does a great job at covering some of kelps greatest threats, including the california heat waves of 2014 and 2016 which are believed to be the reason that california lost 90% of its coastal kelp forest. It’s not just natural disasters though, pollution is another force of destruction for kelp and as soon as I mention overfishing any passionate ecologist will get excited at the name James Estes, who discovered the fascinating relationship between killer whales, otters, purple urchins and kelp. It’s an awesome piece of research featured in the <a href='https://www.theserengetirules.com/' target="_blank">‘Serengeti Rules’</a> documentary but for the sake of this post I’ll briefly summarize: Massive overfishing caused killer whales to predate heavily on sea otters around alaska drastically reducing their numbers, which meant one of the otters main prey items (purple urchins) had free reign to decimate the shoreline kelp forests. Over the course of 6 years from 1991 to 1997 the amount of kelp tissue lost from herbivory had increased from 1.1% per day to 47.5% per day. All of this sounds pretty damning for kelp but there’s a reason I think kelp may play such a large role in saving the day in decades to come.
        <br>
        <br>
        As we rapidly lose huge swathes of rainforest and acidify the oceans destroying reefs and photosynthesising organisms, it becomes evident that a lot of our treasured natural resources are slipping from the grasp of those who love it and falling into the greasy palms of those who can exploit it. The planet is warming up and with it our environments are degrading. The losses of kelp at lower latitudes due to high temperatures are but one example of this. A slight glimmer of hope for our slimy, underappreciated, carbon sequestering friends is that they do just fine in the cold. It’s predicted that as we continue to lose arctic ice in the north, rocky coastlines will reveal themselves creating an ideal habitat for kelp to establish and grow
    </p>

    <h3>Does the North Hold the Key to Climate Change?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        If we continue to lose Arctic ice and kelp does establish more comfortably in the far north it will be a fantastic asset in the fight back. Kelp has been shown to push against ocean acidification by generating so much oxygen from its rapid growth and photosynthesis. If we can prevent the many threats to kelp in these areas then we could see huge growth of kelp forests in the north. As a slight aside, the also underappreciated northern Taiga biomes are a tremendous carbon sink and store, currently storing more carbon than both temperate and tropical rainforest combined. Lets just hope we don’t destroy 12 million hectares of the stuff every year! Oh wait... What’s that? We already are? Okay nevermind. Depressing jokes aside it seems regulation of northern deforestation could prove a lot more promising than what we’ve witnessed with our tropical forests. 
    </p>

    <h3>What Can We Do?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        It’s undeniably sad that for kelp to expand into new territories in a warming sea we may have to see further in loss of Arctic ice, especially for such a small positive. Regardless it’s important to consider these small victories when it comes to thinking about the future of our planet and creating new climate policies. Is kelp going to single handedly save the day? Of course not, no one thing is, but just like every facet of our struggle against climate change, we need to focus on what we can do, not what we’re losing. Whether it’s reducing meat in your diet, avoiding flying in planes or planting a few trees, it all adds up. We need every asset we can muster if we’re going to see any shifts in a positive direction. Studies such as this one are essential if we’re going to create an accurate picture of our future and even more so to give us additional tools to push against the decades of raising temperatures and environmental degradation.
