        How Do Modern Farming Practices Affect Mycorrhizae And Why Is It Important?
    </h1>


    <p class="para-margin">
        Fungi! ... Again! In my first post on the subject I explained all about how AM fungi were discovered and the mechanisms by which they function. If you read the post or know anything about mycorrhiza, then it’ll be clear to you just how important they are. 

        So if there are these super important organisms that create mega support networks for plants across the world, then how do they tie into our agricultural systems? Well this post will be taking a brief look at what mycorrhizae do for our largest food production systems and explain why our biggest farming practices may be highly detrimental to AM fungi, and even crop production itself!
    </p>
       
    <h3>Quick Recap on Why Mycorrhizae are so Awesome! </h3>

    <p class="p-heading phone-heading para-margin">
        There’s four key features that make mycorrhizae extremely desirable to any host plant:
    </p>
    
        <ul class="list-para">
            <li>
                The first clear one being they act as extra roots for plants. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/agro/2009054#:~:text=In%20mycorrhizal%20associations%2C%20the%20fungal" target="_blank"> absorb additional nutrients</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s005720050209" target="_blank">water</a>, and spread them between host plants in exchange for sugars, which the fungi aren’t very good at making.
            </li>

            <li>
                There are quite a few ideas surrounding how mycorrhizae <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10886-012-0134-6" target="_blank">improve disease resistance for plants</a>. Most of the attention is on farmed crops because that’s where the money is. Pathogens are complicated and it’s no wonder that there are a few ways in which the mycorrhizae provide some extra defenses.
            </li>

            <li>
                Communication is key for any organism’s success. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plv050/201398" target="_blank">Mycorrhizae provide an extra dimension for plants to communicate with one another</a>. They share information through hormones and even electrical signals. Mycorrhizae use ion channels to act as a sort of electrical circuit.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01750.x" target="_blank">Mycorrhizae help to maintain soil aggregate and structure</a> both through their root systems and, importantly, with a glycoprotein they produce, called glomalin. 
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        These features highlight why it can be so valuable to maximise the presence of AM fungi on farmland. Modern intensive farming practices are proving to be detrimental to soil health and food production in the long term.

    <h3>Effects of Intensive Tilling</h3>

    <p class="p-heading">
        The most intensive and harsh farming practices that are commonly used on a large scale are fertilizers, pesticides and tilling. There are a huge range of truly horrible environmental side effects from the chemicals we use on our crops, but I won’t go into that now. Even if we put the negative effects to one side, the use of fertilizers is still hugely unsustainable due to the fact they are a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18326-7" target="_blank">  finite resource and we are already facing shortages.</a> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Tilling is the process by which soil is turned over to allow easy access to nutrients. While tilling is one of the most effective ways to increase crop yields in the short term, it is highly unsustainable and damaging in the long run. Not only does tilling actually <a href="https://www.farmcarbontoolkit.org.uk/news/tillage-and-emissions-ploughing-through-science#:~:text=Emissions%20from%20tillage&text=When%20soil%20is%20cultivated%2C%20carbon,oxygen%20following%20a%20mechanical%20cultivation." target="_blank">release CO2</a>, but it’s also the primary cause of artificial “<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/soil-erosion-and-degradation" target="_blank">soil erosion</a>". It is predicted that we have lost half of the world’s topsoil over the last 150 years. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The main concern with soil erosion is the loss of available farmland through decreased structure, nutrient content and salinity. This is an incredibly serious issue considering how much food production is predicted to rise, in order to accommodate our growing population. Soil degradation also causes runoff sediment to enter water courses, reducing habitability for organisms. The streams you pass on your dog walks around farmlands are NOT meant to be gross and muddy brown!
        <br>
        <br>
        As for fungi, studies have shown that tilling has a <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6bv5h1nv" target="_blank"> negative effect on AM fungi communities and propagation</a>. It’s theorised that although fungi typically only live for around 2 years, they may well use old root pathways as means to encounter new fungi propagules. After learning about the positive effects of mycorrhizae I would certainly be seeking to maximise their presence among my plants
    </p>

    <h3>Should We Move Away From Tilling?</h3>

    <p class="p-heading">
        Yes! It’s tried and tested. While tilling does increase crop yields in the short term its long term effects are just too unsustainable. As much as I’m preaching from the perspective of an environmental nut, there has been evidence to show <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191206132228.htm" target="_blank">reduced tilling can even benefit crop yields on a longer timescale</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The link above says that on average it may take around 11 years before the benefits of reduced till can be fully realised. In the 1930’s during the great depression America’s farmland was hit by terrible dust storms. The storms resulted in droughts across huge swathes of farmland. Reduced till practices played a key role in pulling America out of the dust bowl. Farmland was allowed time to recover and re-establish, ready for more productive farming in the future. In a world of rapidly declining soil health, it may be time to echo the folks who survived the dust bowl. We need to start taking greater care of the land used to grow our food.
