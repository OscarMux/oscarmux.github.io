            I have recently discovered the beauty of West Sussex and the South Downs. Initially by exploring Beachy Head for the first time with my partner over a year ago, and after a suggestion from a friend, the Kingley Vale nature reserve. The friend’s suggestion was actually regarding a specific part of Kingley Vale known as the “Devil’s Humps”, and with a name like that we had to visit...
            <br>
            <br>
            The Devil’s Humps (as pictured below) are some of the last surviving barrows of the south downs. They could date as far back as the bronze age, up to 6000 years ago! It was truly spectacular to be walking over an area of such ancient human history.

            There are four barrows in total and the view from on top of them is phenomenal. To the north there’s the expansive, sweeping landscape of the South Downs and on the other side of you, to the south, is the glimmer of the sea over Bognor Regis. A little further west and it’s a flat expanse of estuaries in the Chichester Harbour, which is an official area of outstanding natural beauty.

            As I stood with my partner on top of the first of the four humps, icy wind whipping across our cheeks, I noticed a large bird gracefully gliding with the wind. Initially I thought it might have been a buzzard, but after a moment of watching it my mind was flung back to a university field trip in northern Spain. We’d seen eurasian black vultures and my course tutor had identified them as such by describing them as great barn doors flying through the sky. This bird certainly had similar characteristics to a barn door. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Through my binoculars I realised that the bird was far too large to be a buzzard. I stood perplexed. The bird made a slight crook in its wings and rapidly descended into a nearby tree where I got a great look at its true size, as well as its large, hooked beak. Eventually, we decided to continue our walk after unsuccessful attempts at identifying it.

            Kingley Vale is a hilly net of twisted, ancient, yew-dominated woodland. The yew’s branches warp and bend, showing off their age. There is rich folklore surrounding the trees. It’s said that Viking invaders were repelled by the men of Chichester. These Vikings fell among the trees, their ghosts forever haunting the woods of Kingley Vale. The trees themselves are said to come to life with the spirits of the warriors during the night... When you see the tentacle-like limbs and size of the trees, it’s easy to see how such beliefs emerged.

            Despite the uniqueness and beauty of the area, it was hard to fully absorb the beauty of the nature surrounding me. The image of that great bird replayed in my mind; when we arrived home I quickly began looking up what it could have been. I googled “largest UK bird,” and white tailed eagle fit the bill perfectly. In all honesty I didn’t think we had white tailed eagles in England. I knew there was a small population in Scotland and I had seen news that there were plans to introduce them in Norfolk but I didn’t know there were any down here on the south coast. 
            <br>

            A bit more googling took me to the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. A wonderful organisation dedicated to restoring wildlife and natural ecosystems across the UK. I didn’t know at the time, but they played a huge role in the Rutland Osprey Project, which I was fortunate enough to visit. It’s a large reservoir with fantastic bird watching opportunities, it’s one of the few places in the UK where you can see ospreys. We saw several breeding pairs nesting on the water, they also have cameras giving you a close up view from in the nests themselves. I also learned that the Roy Dennis Foundation have white tailed eagle breeding projects on the Isle of Wight which is only 20 miles (as the eagle flies) away from where I spotted the bird! With that information I was certain of what I had seen. I was thrilled to have spotted such a rare and beautiful animal. I was also a little frustrated that I was unable to truly appreciate it at the time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Around 500 CE there were around 1000-1400 pairs in the UK, but after heavy persecution during the middle ages, the last known breeding pair in the south of england were gone by 1780. It’s because of organisations like the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation that the UK is able to reclaim some of its lost wildlife. I am hopeful that, down the road,  the UK’s wildlife will grow. We already have newly established beaver populations and there are plans to introduce other key players into UK ecosystems: bison, lynx, a number of birds and even wolves. I’ve seen evidence of boars first-hand in the Wye Valley.

            With such high rates of biodiversity loss worldwide, it’s so important to take the time to appreciate experiences like my own. Hope and hard work are what’s required to try to restore environments, boost biodiversity and create healthy ecosystems. When the future’s looking bleak, that’s when we need to focus on what we can do, and double down on our efforts to make a positive change to natural systems across the world.

            Thanks so much for reading, I just wanted to share the experience I had and spread the word about the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation too.
